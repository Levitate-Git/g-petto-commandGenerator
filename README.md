# Project G'petto
## Introduction

The python codes for calculating the prop trajectory are uploaded in this repository. G'petto is used for moving physical objects that weigh up to 1.0 kg (technically 1.5kg but it is advertised as 1.0 to be on the safe side) in 3D space. The first use cases are for 1D (on a line, eg. up and down) and 2D (on a plane, eg. up-down-left-right) motions. 

## G'petto-Smart Pulleys

G'petto is an unusual IOT hardware solution that enables window display designers, visual merchandisers, and stage artists to design their own shows with moving objects. It is almost like creating a choreography for inanimate objects. The objects are suspended on the ropes (braided fishing lines) that go out of each G'petto smart pulley. How the objects move depends on the users' creation. 

On the user side, there are two parts of G'petto:

1- The hardware, \
2- The motion-design interface

### Hardware
Each set of hardware consists of 4 smart pulleys, 1 control device, and 1 remote controller. The pulleys and the control device are meant to be fastened to aluminum profiles that are included in the box. The profile should be fastened to ceiling or a wall with appropriate measures.

### Design Interface
The subscribers of G'petto are given access to a unique motion-design interface. It allows them to create animations (like the ones you do on PowerPoint) just by putting dots on the screen. The dots represent the physical spaces the hung objects are meant to pass in real life (relative to the bottom of G'petto pulleys). User specifies the time it takes for an object to travel from a dot on a keyframe to the one on the next keyframe. This way, s/he sets the speed of the object. Once all position and speed values are set, the new choreography is ready.
